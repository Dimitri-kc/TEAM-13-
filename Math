/****
 * So for Question 3 of the worksheet it said that we have to create a repository and name it Team-XX
 * and then do this task on it so I've used the Team-13 repository for this task. If anything we can put this
 * file in a miscellaneous folder or something like that so it's not just floating around in the main directory
 * but we still keep it with our main work just in case we need to refer back to it or if we need to show it.
 * We'll use this repository for any other miscellaneous tasks we have to do as well but for our main work too- 
 * just to keep everything in one place.
 * 
 * REMEMBER: To pull before you start working on the code and to push when you're done.
 * 
 * I've attempted to set this task up so we can all do it together but someone more skilled 
 * might want to double check the code especially when testing it to see if it works properly.
 * 
 * To do this task what i've done is created a class called MathFunctions
 * and inside this class it's going to take two numbers and perform all
 * of the maths operations we're being asked to do on those two numbers.
 * Once you've done your individual function make a commit and push it and
 * in the comments leave the information the worksheet asked for.
 * 
 * So once you write the line e.g. System.out.println("Added together; " + add(num1, num2));
 * you would leave a comment saying e.g. // Done by Navdeep and then towards the bottom of the code write
 * your function with your full name and student number. You can copy the public static format and add your function
